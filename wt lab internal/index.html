        <p> The price of Bitcoin dipped below $30,000 for the first time since January, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s volatility in a time when more and more people are interested in getting in on the action.</p>
        
        <p>We’ve talked to investing experts and financial advisors who advise against sinking much of your portfolio into the asset class for this very reason. They work with clients to make sure volatile crypto investments aren’t getting in the way of other financial priorities, like saving an emergency fund and paying off high-interest debt.</p>
        
        <p> “You have a high chance of losing it all, but a small chance of winning it big,” says Nate Nieri, a CFP with Modern
        Money Management in San Diego, California. “Don’t gamble an amount that would burden your family or prevent you from
        achieving your goals” if you lost it all, he says.</p>
